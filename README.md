# Deli_Java_App

# 

**SubHub** is a console-based Java application that simulates a deli sandwich ordering system. Users can build customized sandwiches, choose from signature sandwich options, and add drinks, chips, and sides to their orders. The app calculates pricing based on size, extras, and provides a printed receipt with detailed breakdowns.
